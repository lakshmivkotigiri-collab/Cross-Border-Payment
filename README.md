## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing cross-border payment transactions using SQL. The dataset contains details such as transaction time, date, sender and receiver accounts, amount, currency, bank locations, payment type, and labels for money laundering activities.

The main objective is to perform data-driven analysis to detect suspicious activities, identify high-risk transaction patterns, and gain valuable insights into international money flows.
